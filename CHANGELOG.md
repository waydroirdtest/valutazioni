  - bump package/app version to 0.3.6

## [0.3.5](https://github.com/realbestia1/erdb/compare/v0.3.4...v0.3.5) - 2026-04-03

- Add backdrop ratings size support and bump to v0.3.5 ([f8eb982](https://github.com/realbestia1/erdb/commit/f8eb9824915fdb235cef15f41a7ef2935da1f26b))

  - expose the new control in the workspace/configurator UI for backdrop previews
  - persist backdropRatingsSize through config export/import and token-backed config flows
  - forward backdropRatingsSize through the proxy and token-aware image generation pipeline
  - apply the new size option in the backdrop renderer without affecting thumbnail sizing behavior
  - fix final image cache key generation so changing backdropRatingsSize invalidates cached renders correctly
  - bump package/app version to 0.3.5

## [0.3.4](https://github.com/realbestia1/erdb/compare/v0.3.3...v0.3.4) - 2026-04-03

- Bump version to 0.3.4; fix thumbnail badge ([fe2e2a4](https://github.com/realbestia1/erdb/commit/fe2e2a448223a26f3345a273706a7d5178c8e049))
  Update project version to 0.3.4 (package.json and UI reference) and adjust route image badge logic: only use thumbnailVerticalBadgeContent when the thumbnail rating layout is vertical, otherwise fall back to 'standard'. Also updated build metadata (tsconfig.tsbuildinfo).

## [0.3.3](https://github.com/realbestia1/erdb/compare/v0.3.2...v0.3.3) - 2026-04-03

- Bump package to 0.3.3; fix backdrop badge layout ([2502917](https://github.com/realbestia1/erdb/commit/25029174080311ef786450d173321c955d386222))
  Import and use isVerticalBackdropRatingLayout in app/[type]/[id]/route.tsx so backdrop badge content uses the vertical variant only when backdropRatingsLayout is vertical (falls back to 'standard' otherwise). Update components/home-page.tsx to reflect currentVersion 0.3.3 and bump package version in package.json/package-lock.json. tsconfig.tsbuildinfo updated by the build. This fixes incorrect badge selection for backdrop images and publishes a patch version bump.

## [0.3.2](https://github.com/realbestia1/erdb/compare/v0.3.1...v0.3.2) - 2026-04-03

- Fix poster token badge layout so stacked is ignored for non-vertical poster layouts ([13e1967](https://github.com/realbestia1/erdb/commit/13e196797ff88c86ba3ae91f9f78718080905612))
  Updated the poster render pipeline to apply verticalBadgeContent=stacked only when posterRatingsLayout is vertical (left, right, or left-right).

  This prevents tokens using Poster Layout=top from incorrectly rendering poster badges in stacked mode when a lingering verticalBadgeContent=stacked value is present in the token or imported config.

## [0.3.1](https://github.com/realbestia1/erdb/compare/v0.3.0...v0.3.1) - 2026-04-03

- Add token-based accounts and workspace APIs ([9244088](https://github.com/realbestia1/erdb/commit/924408803cf9ba549268bd540fd8ff0ee93e5b04))
  Introduce a token-based account system and workspace flow. Adds new API endpoints (/api/token, /api/workspace-auth, /api/workspace-config) and libraries to manage tokens, accounts, and workspace sessions, plus an accounts DB. Make renderer and proxy token-aware: image routes accept/respect token configs, proxy can build config from a token, and cache/version seeding uses token update timestamps. Update configurator and docs/UI to support login/registration, persistent active token, token-driven preview/proxy patterns, and workspace session handling. Minor docs and .env.example updates (ERDB_DATA_DIR) to reflect the new workspace/token features.
- rollback ([18c5a8e](https://github.com/realbestia1/erdb/commit/18c5a8ee9f753dcaf690c34a3c33743c18897f1a))

## [0.3.0](https://github.com/realbestia1/erdb/compare/v0.2.12...v0.3.0) - 2026-04-03

- Add token-based accounts, API & workspace UI ([9abcadb](https://github.com/realbestia1/erdb/commit/9abcadb4a5b60d414fdb7ff6731488f76416e877))
  Introduce a token-based account system and workspace flow. Adds new API endpoints (/api/token, /api/workspace-auth, /api/workspace-config) and libraries to manage tokens, accounts, and workspace sessions. The image renderer and proxy were updated to resolve per-token configuration server-side (token-aware routes and proxy config builders), and cache/versioning now uses token update timestamps. The configurator and home UI were updated to support login/registration, persistent active token, token-driven preview/proxy patterns, and workspace session handling. Minor docs and .env.example updates included (ERDB_DATA_DIR).

## [0.2.12](https://github.com/realbestia1/erdb/compare/v0.2.11...v0.2.12) - 2026-04-02

- Bump version to 0.2.12 and normalize path split ([65e7701](https://github.com/realbestia1/erdb/commit/65e77012f9ea256c6bdc5b1d51c77c1c831f8479))
  Update package.json version to 0.2.12 and update the HomePage currentVersion string accordingly. Improve getFilePath by splitting keys on both forward and backslashes (/ and \) before sanitizing segments to handle Windows and mixed-path separators correctly.

## [0.2.11](https://github.com/realbestia1/erdb/compare/v0.2.10...v0.2.11) - 2026-04-02

- Add thumbnail rating style and bump version ([8581d4f](https://github.com/realbestia1/erdb/commit/8581d4f2613cb0518cc0c88a82895372d8c4aba8))
  Introduce thumbnailRatingStyle handling in HomePage: include it in the preview-type rating selection logic, add it to the exported state list, and persist it to the config. Also update the in-component currentVersion and bump the package version to 0.2.11.

## [0.2.10](https://github.com/realbestia1/erdb/compare/v0.2.9...v0.2.10) - 2026-04-02

- Add thumbnailRatingStyle support ([42c6ae4](https://github.com/realbestia1/erdb/commit/42c6ae4a811b5caf4b60bd16f8e903f48ab31f1f))
  Introduce per-type thumbnail rating style handling so thumbnails can use an independent ratingStyle. Changes include:

  - app/[type]/[id]/route.tsx: parse a global rating style param and per-type overrides (poster, backdrop, thumbnail, logo) and choose the appropriate style based on imageType.
  - components/home-page.tsx: add thumbnailRatingStyle state, wire it into aiometadata pattern building, config serialization, payload handling, preview selection, and UI handlers; update currentVersion to 0.2.10.
  - lib/aiIntegrationPrompt.ts: document new poster/backdrop/thumbnail/logo ratingStyle params and update URL build logic to consider thumbnailRatingStyle.
  - package.json: bump package version to 0.2.10.

  These changes allow explicit control over thumbnail rating visuals without affecting backdrop or poster styles.

## [0.2.9](https://github.com/realbestia1/erdb/compare/v0.2.8...v0.2.9) - 2026-04-02

- Improve proxy error handling and fetch retry ([6e0b190](https://github.com/realbestia1/erdb/commit/6e0b190bcec7bd3626eee27ec6796fd89105f487))
  Wrap proxy GET handler in a try/catch and return a 500 on unexpected errors. Read upstream responses as arrayBuffer and decode with TextDecoder before JSON.parse to avoid re-reading streamed bodies, and reuse the decoded buffer for passthrough/error responses while preserving CORS headers. Increase default fetchWithRetry timeout to 15000ms and expand recognized timeout/network error codes to improve resilience. Bump package version to 0.2.9 and update displayed currentVersion in the UI.

## [0.2.8](https://github.com/realbestia1/erdb/compare/v0.2.7...v0.2.8) - 2026-04-02

- Improve Docker font handling and image response types ([3f2033f](https://github.com/realbestia1/erdb/commit/3f2033f99d1cb7a922747d337360f439ec8031b0))
  Update Dockerfiles to skip automatic font install by default (ERDB_SKIP_FONT_INSTALL) and add bash/curl to Alpine deps; copy and execute scripts/install-fonts-linux.sh (with chmod) in build/runtime images so fonts are installed reliably. Refactor server image rendering flow in app/[type]/[id]/route.tsx: change in-flight maps to carry RenderedImagePayload, return payload objects from internal branches, and centralize the final respond(...) call to ensure consistent response construction. Also bump app version to 0.2.8 (package.json) and update displayed currentVersion in the home page component.

## [0.2.7](https://github.com/realbestia1/erdb/compare/v0.2.6...v0.2.7) - 2026-04-02

- Add custom logo variants and caching ([88ce2c3](https://github.com/realbestia1/erdb/commit/88ce2c3c01295d72d29043f4da204bc002a8de88))
  Introduce custom logo generation and variant support with SVG output, selectable font variants, and custom primary/secondary/outline colors. Adds in-memory + object-storage caching for generated logo variants, new cache keys/TTL, and storage read/write helpers; integrates custom-logo and ratings-only modes into the rendering pipeline and query params (logoMode, logoFontVariant, logoPrimary/Secondary/Outline). Improve title localization by picking translated titles from TMDB translations, bump final image renderer cache version, and standardize response/cache headers. Also add a docs AI integration prompt and copy button component, expose new logo options in the docs and home view types, and include various small refactors to image rendering, cache keys, and object storage behavior.

## [0.2.6](https://github.com/realbestia1/erdb/compare/v0.2.5...v0.2.6) - 2026-04-02

- fix: prevent preview image clipping on zoom ([425f863](https://github.com/realbestia1/erdb/commit/425f863d25c1c194ee2e8a2c8cf5858ec5ba6020))
  - Changed `object-cover` to `object-contain` for the live preview image in `workspace-page-view.tsx`.
  - Bumped package version to 0.2.6.
  This resolves a UI rendering issue where badges placed on the exact edges of the generated image would get cropped or skewed when the user zooms in/out of the page. By containing the image fully within the wrapper regardless of fractional aspect ratio differences, all image boundaries and components always remain completely visible.

## [0.2.5](https://github.com/realbestia1/erdb/compare/v0.2.4...v0.2.5) - 2026-04-02

- fix(renderer): standardize logo rating height to 100px and remove auto-scaling ([7265a12](https://github.com/realbestia1/erdb/commit/7265a12c1e05c6eea474cb3d25d6c37dfc733d4c))
  - Removed the automatic boosting system for rating badges in the 'logo' image type.
  - Disabled dynamic scale calculation based on the original logo aspect ratio.
  - Implemented fixed badge metrics (iconSize: 84px, paddingY: 8px) to guarantee a consistent 100px height.
  - Optimized fontSize (62px), paddingX (32px), and gap (20px) for better aesthetics at a fixed size.
  - Ensured badge size remains constant (preserveBadgeSize: true) even when multiple ratings are displayed.

## [0.2.4](https://github.com/realbestia1/erdb/compare/v0.2.3...v0.2.4) - 2026-04-01

- preserve better readability on very wide logos ([c6603cf](https://github.com/realbestia1/erdb/commit/c6603cfd3e9edf15f485b0e29501c0431dfc353c))

## [0.2.3](https://github.com/realbestia1/erdb/compare/v0.2.2...v0.2.3) - 2026-04-01

- bump to v0.2.3, keep logo ratings on one row, and restore standalone CSS in local start txt ([46e8890](https://github.com/realbestia1/erdb/commit/46e8890ae511090dc5012b4488e57a52214fb818))
  - bump package version from 0.2.2 to 0.2.3
  - keep logo ratings on a single row and extend the canvas width instead of wrapping to multiple lines
  - improve logo badge spacing and preserve better readability on very wide logos
  - fix local production startup so the standalone server also sees `.next/static` and `public`, restoring CSS/assets when using `npm run build` + `npm run start`
  - align the frontend version fallback with v0.2.3

## [0.2.2](https://github.com/realbestia1/erdb/compare/v0.2.1...v0.2.2) - 2026-04-01

- bump to v0.2.2 and remove mobile configurator nested scrolling ([0e54627](https://github.com/realbestia1/erdb/commit/0e546273a3b85e382817c59c7645bb9bbb145b05))
  - bump package version from 0.2.1 to 0.2.2
  - remove the extra internal mobile scroll from the configurator shell
  - let the rating provider list expand naturally on mobile instead of using its own vertical scroll
  - make generated config string and proxy manifest boxes wrap on mobile while keeping desktop scrolling behavior
  - align changelog and frontend version fallback with v0.2.2

## [0.2.1](https://github.com/realbestia1/erdb/compare/v0.2.0...v0.2.1) - 2026-04-01

- implement robust fetch with retries for TMDB metadata ([76caef7](https://github.com/realbestia1/erdb/commit/76caef7a97c37bf983b48a0081becfd54f360c9a))
  Added lib/request.ts: Introduced a fetchWithRetry utility to handle transient network failures.
  Improved Resilience: Implemented automatic 3-attempt retries with exponential backoff for ConnectTimeoutError and other networking issues.
  Optimized Timeouts: Set an 8-second timeout per request attempt to ensure faster recovery and better responsiveness.
  Route Integration: Updated the main metadata route (app/[type]/[id]/route.tsx) and the proxy layer to use the new robust fetching mechanism.
  Bug Fix: Resolved frequent TypeError: fetch failed caused by TMDB connection timeouts.

## [0.2.0](https://github.com/realbestia1/erdb/compare/v0.1.27...v0.2.0) - 2026-04-01

- finalize dedicated API docs flow and bump package version to 0.1.27
  Kept the new standalone `/docs` page as the single place for API documentation, linked the homepage to it, removed the old duplicated API docs content from the main page UI, and clarified `realimdb:` usage for addons that actually source series or episode metadata from IMDb IDs.

## [0.1.26](https://github.com/realbestia1/erdb/compare/v0.1.25...v0.1.26) - 2026-04-01

- add dedicated API docs page and bump package version to 0.1.26
  Added a standalone `/docs` page for the ERDB public API surface, linked it from the homepage, documented renderer/proxy/helper endpoints with real query behavior, and clarified that `realimdb:` should be used for addons that actually source series or episode metadata from IMDb IDs.

## [0.1.25](https://github.com/realbestia1/erdb/compare/v0.1.24...v0.1.25) - 2026-03-31

  Updated the anime rating provider badges to use cleaner and more accurate provider assets, with special fixes for MyAnimeList, AniList, and Kitsu rendering. This includes centering and scaling adjustments for MAL, switching AniList to its official icon asset, and replacing the Kitsu badge with the exact favicon asset used by the official Kitsu web app. Also bumped the package version from 0.1.24 to 0.1.25.
- update ([671b47e](https://github.com/realbestia1/erdb/commit/671b47ef0a437bedfb1f57377361cfca09f57e48))

## [0.1.24](https://github.com/realbestia1/erdb/compare/v0.1.23...v0.1.24) - 2026-03-31

- Bump to v0.1.24 and add configurable logo rating limits ([02885e0](https://github.com/realbestia1/erdb/commit/02885e0e093ff053ec086fe8e1f5255df965ca86))
  - bump package version to 0.1.24
  - add logoRatingsMax so logo renders can cap the maximum number of rating badges
  - expose logoRatingsMax across the renderer, UI, config string, proxy config, and AiOMetadata patterns
  - preserve empty rating params so disabling all providers correctly bypasses image rendering instead of falling back to all ratings
  - update .github README and AI integration prompt to document the new logoRatingsMax behavior

## [0.1.23](https://github.com/realbestia1/erdb/compare/v0.1.22...v0.1.23) - 2026-03-31

- Bump to v0.1.23 and refine logo badge rendering ([0b41bf0](https://github.com/realbestia1/erdb/commit/0b41bf0e243d44db83574b18e1c60014c49a3a6f))
